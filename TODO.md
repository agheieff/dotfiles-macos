# Configuration TODOs

## Keyboard Issues
- [ ] Win+Ctrl combinations still input characters instead of just acting as modifiers
  - Tried: Karabiner complex modifications, NSGlobalDomain settings, apple_mirrored_widgets_disable
  - May need to investigate Karabiner's "lazy" modifier or create specific rules for each Win+Ctrl combination
  - Alternative: Use a different modifier combination for move-to-workspace-and-follow

## Pending Features from Sway Config
- [ ] Application launching shortcuts (Win+Return for terminal, Win+B for browser, etc.)
- [ ] Media control keybindings (volume, brightness, play/pause)
- [ ] Screenshot shortcuts with various modes
- [ ] System function shortcuts (lock, reload, power menu)
- [ ] Clipboard manager integration
- [ ] Emoji picker
- [ ] Rofi alternatives for macOS (app launcher, window switcher)
